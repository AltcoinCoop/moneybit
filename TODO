# Grand Scheme

- Encryption tunnel


# Details

- Use logging-effect for logging debug info
- on `configure`, move wallet files if necessary (closing on change)

- Progress:
  - multi-stage progress - making the wallet vs. opening / refreshing
  - mnemonic seems to halt <1% during creation - should timeout, then just open to refresh?
